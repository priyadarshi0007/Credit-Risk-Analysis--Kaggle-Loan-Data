# Credit-Risk-Analysis--Kaggle-Loan-Data

The dataset has been procured from https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data 

So here we will be analyisng the above dataset and I will be analyising data and will be doing prediction, I will be analysing the dataset in following parameters 

        1. Probability of Default(PD)
        2. Loss of given Default (LGD)
        3. Exposure at Default (EAD)

Default probability is the likelihood over a specified period, usually one year, that a borrower will not be able to make scheduled repayments. It can be applied to a variety of different risk management or credit analysis scenarios. Also called the probability of default (PD), it depends, not only on the borrower's characteristics but also on the economic environment.

Creditors typically want a higher interest rate to compensate for bearing higher default risk. Financial metrics—such as cash flows relative to debt, revenues or operating margin trends, and the use of leverage—are common considerations when evaluating the risk. A company's ability to execute a business plan and a borrower's willingness to pay are sometimes factored into the analysis as well.

Loss given default or LGD is the share of an asset that is lost if a borrower defaults. It is a common parameter in risk models and also a parameter used in the calculation of economic capital, expected loss or regulatory capital under Basel II for a banking institution.

Exposure at default (EAD) is the total value a bank is exposed to when a loan defaults. Using the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, financial institutions calculate their risk. Banks often use internal risk management default models to estimate respective EAD systems. Outside of the banking industry, EAD is known as credit exposure.
